# Battleship
Battleship (also known as Battleships or Sea Battle[3]) is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids (paper or board) on which each player's fleet of warships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

## WHY
This Battleship project was part of my self-guided education through The Odin Project JS Curriculum. The intention of this was to practice the basics of testing using Jest and object oriented principle.
